'''Defines GUI elements that arrange their children in certain ways:

- :class:`.Container`, a very simple element with no fancy layout stuff, meant to group other elements together (e.g. to put multiple Paragraph elements as a single List item)
- :class:`.List`, a bulleted/numbered list of elements
- :class:`.Grid`
- :class:`.Viewport`, a small scrollable window viewing a large element
